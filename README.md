============================

LD45 Entry by Jimbly - "SOMtHINGa from NoThINGa"

* Using [Javascript libGlov/GLOV.js framework](https://github.com/Jimbly/glovjs)

Start with: `npm start` (after running `npm i` once)

TODO:
  Infinite scroll with auto-zoom out matching aspect ratio better?
    Even if not infinite scroll, use whole width and zoom in when short
    Can start with smaller levels with larger icons and such
  Art
    Separate fission/fusion/both pipes?
  Funny quotes for each element?
    View periodic table minigame that shows all discovered elements?
  Title screen?
    At least splash image for sharing and LD posting
