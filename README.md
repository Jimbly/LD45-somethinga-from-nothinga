Ludum Dare 45 - Start With Nothing
============================

LD45 Entry by Jimbly - "SOMtHINGa from NoThINGa"

* Using [Javascript libGlov/GLOV.js framework](https://github.com/Jimbly/glovjs)

Start with: `npm start` (after running `npm i` once)

TODO:
  Transition screens between levels - show title, show hint
  Atmospheric sounds:
    burble, machine noises?
  Art
    Separate fission/fusion/both pipes?
  Funny quotes for each element?
  Title screen?
  Infinite scroll with auto-zoom out matching aspect ratio better?
    Even if not infinite scroll, use whole width and zoom in when short
    Can start with smaller levels with larger icons and such
